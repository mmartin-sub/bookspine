# BookSpine Baseline Requirements

## Overview

This document establishes the complete baseline requirements for the BookSpine project, including all original requirements plus additional features that were implemented beyond the initial scope. This serves as the authoritative reference for future development and maintenance.

## Project Scope

BookSpine is a comprehensive Python tool that provides:
1. **Book Spine Calculator**: Calculate precise spine dimensions based on various parameters
2. **Keyword Theme Extraction (KTE)**: Extract keywords and themes from book content using AI
3. **Modern Development Tools**: Professional-grade development environment and tooling
4. **Production-Ready Infrastructure**: Comprehensive testing, documentation, and deployment capabilities

## Core Requirements

### Book Spine Calculator Requirements

#### Requirement 1: Input Processing
**User Story:** As a book publisher, I want to provide book metadata in a structured format, so that the tool can accurately calculate the spine dimensions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN the user provides a PDF file THEN the system SHALL extract page count information while minimizing memory usage for large files.
2. WHEN the user provides metadata manually THEN the system SHALL accept and validate the following parameters:
   - Total page count
   - Paper type (e.g., "MCG", "MCS", "ECB", "OFF")
   - Binding type (e.g., "Softcover Perfect Bound", "Hardcover Casewrap/Linen")
   - Paper weight in gsm (Grams per Square Meter)
   - Preferred unit system (metric or imperial)
3. WHEN input is missing required parameters THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages.
4. WHEN the system receives a PDF file THEN it SHALL verify it contains valid book content.
5. WHEN the user specifies a printer service THEN the system SHALL load the appropriate calculation parameters from a dedicated configuration file for that service.
6. WHEN operating in a workflow environment THEN the system SHALL avoid creating persistent temporary files that could conflict with parallel executions.

#### Requirement 2: Spine Width Calculation
**User Story:** As a book designer, I want accurate spine width calculations based on industry-standard formulas, so that I can create properly sized spine designs.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN calculating spine width for Softcover Perfect Bound with general paper THEN the system SHALL use the formula: Spine Width (inches) = (pages / 444) + 0.06".
2. WHEN calculating spine width for Softcover Perfect Bound with 460 PPI paper THEN the system SHALL use the formula: Spine Width (inches) = (pages / 460) + 0.06".
3. WHEN using the general metric formula THEN the system SHALL calculate: Spine in mm = (paperweight in gsm × paper bulk × (page count / 2)) / 1000 + (2 × cover thickness).
4. WHEN using the general imperial formula THEN the system SHALL calculate: Spine in inch = ((paperweight in gsm × paper bulk × (page count / 2)) / 1000 + (2 × cover thickness)) / 25.4.
5. WHEN calculating for Hardcover binding THEN the system SHALL use appropriate cover thickness values (e.g., 2.0 mm or 3.0 mm).
6. WHEN calculating for different paper types THEN the system SHALL use the correct paper bulk values:
