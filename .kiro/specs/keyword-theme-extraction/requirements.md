# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Keyword and Theme Extraction (KTE) module is a foundational component within the AI coding agent for book cover development. It is designed to extract the most relevant keywords and core themes from a book's content, serving as a standalone sub-project with a clear API for integration with other modules (e.g., Title Generation, Image Sourcing, Color Selection). The module will analyze pre-processed text from books to identify key phrases that capture the essence of the content, with special emphasis on multi-word phrases and content from headers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Input Processing

**User Story:** As a developer integrating the KTE module, I want to provide pre-processed text content to the module, so that it can extract relevant keywords and themes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text content is provided to the KTE module THEN the system SHALL accept and process it.
2. WHEN text content with tagged structural elements (e.g., headers) is provided THEN the system SHALL recognize and preserve these tags for prioritization.
3. WHEN text content is provided in different formats (plain text, HTML-like tags, markdown) THEN the system SHALL normalize it for consistent processing.
4. WHEN empty or invalid text is provided THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message.

### Requirement 2: Keyword Extraction Using KeyBERT

**User Story:** As a user of the KTE module, I want the system to use KeyBERT for keyword extraction, so that I get semantically relevant keywords suitable for creative tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing text content THEN the system SHALL use KeyBERT as the primary keyword extraction algorithm.
2. WHEN extracting keywords THEN the system SHALL identify both single words and multi-word phrases.
3. WHEN using KeyBERT THEN the system SHALL calculate and include relevance scores for each extracted keyword/phrase.
4. WHEN extracting keywords THEN the system SHALL prioritize multi-word phrases over single words when they have similar relevance.
5. WHEN processing text THEN the system SHALL handle texts of varying lengths efficiently.

### Requirement 3: Header Content Prioritization

**User Story:** As a user of the KTE module, I want the system to give higher priority to terms found in headers, so that the most important thematic information is captured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing text with tagged headers THEN the system SHALL assign higher weighting to terms found within these headers.
2. WHEN calculating keyword relevance THEN the system SHALL factor in the header weighting to adjust the final relevance score.
3. WHEN headers of different levels are present (H1, H2, etc.) THEN the system SHALL apply proportional weighting based on header importance.
4. WHEN no headers are present in the input text THEN the system SHALL proceed with standard keyword extraction without header prioritization.

### Requirement 4: Output Formatting and Ranking

**User Story:** As an integrator of the KTE module, I want to receive a structured output of ranked keywords with relevance scores, so that I can use this data for downstream tasks like image sourcing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN keyword extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL output a structured list of keywords/phrases with their relevance scores.
2. WHEN providing output THEN the system SHALL rank keywords by their relevance score in descending order.
3. WHEN generating output THEN the system SHALL include metadata about the extraction process (e.g., method used, timestamp).
4. WHEN outputting keywords THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between single-word keywords and multi-word phrases.
5. WHEN providing output THEN the system SHALL use a standardized JSON format for easy integration with other modules.

### Requirement 5: Modularity and API Design

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the KTE module to have a well-defined API and be self-contained, so that it can be easily integrated with other components of the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating the KTE module THEN the system SHALL expose a clear API function (e.g., `extract_keywords(text_content, options={})`) for other modules to call.
2. WHEN designing the module THEN the system SHALL minimize dependencies on other project-specific components beyond receiving raw text input.
3. WHEN implementing the module THEN the system SHALL follow a modular design that allows for future extensions (e.g., additional extraction methods).
4. WHEN calling the API THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of extraction parameters (e.g., number of keywords to return, minimum relevance threshold).
5. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.

### Requirement 6: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user of the KTE module, I want it to process text efficiently and handle books of various sizes, so that it can be used in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large texts (e.g., full books) THEN the system SHALL complete extraction within a reasonable time frame.
2. WHEN handling multiple requests THEN the system SHALL manage resources efficiently.
3. WHEN extracting keywords THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate caching mechanisms to avoid redundant processing.
4. WHEN processing very large texts THEN the system SHALL use chunking or other techniques to maintain performance.
5. WHEN deployed in production THEN the system SHALL be able to scale according to demand.

## Additional Requirements (Beyond Original Scope)

### Requirement 7: Hugging Face Model Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable access to AI models for keyword extraction, so that the system can work consistently in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN downloading models THEN the system SHALL cache them locally to avoid repeated downloads.
2. WHEN using Hugging Face models THEN the system SHALL support API token authentication for better rate limits.
3. WHEN rate limiting occurs THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on obtaining and configuring API tokens.
4. WHEN models are cached THEN the system SHALL support offline mode for improved performance.
5. WHEN downloading models THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and error handling.
6. WHEN configuring the system THEN the system SHALL support environment variables for API tokens and cache directories.
7. WHEN running in production THEN the system SHALL handle model loading failures gracefully.

### Requirement 8: Multiple File Format Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to extract keywords from various file formats, so that I can process different types of book content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing PDF files THEN the system SHALL extract text content and process it for keyword extraction.
2. WHEN processing Markdown files THEN the system SHALL preserve header structure for weighting.
