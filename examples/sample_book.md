# Introduction to Data Science

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.

## What is Data Science?

Data science combines statistics, programming, and domain expertise to analyze complex data sets and extract meaningful insights. It involves various techniques including:

- **Statistical Analysis**: Using statistical methods to understand data patterns
- **Machine Learning**: Building predictive models from data
- **Data Visualization**: Creating visual representations of data
- **Big Data Processing**: Handling large-scale data sets

## Key Components

### Data Collection

The first step in any data science project is collecting relevant data. This can involve:

- Web scraping
- API integration
- Database queries
- Survey administration

### Data Cleaning

Raw data often contains errors, missing values, and inconsistencies. Data cleaning involves:

- Removing duplicates
- Handling missing values
- Standardizing formats
- Validating data quality

### Data Analysis

Once data is clean, analysis can begin:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Statistical testing
- Pattern recognition
- Trend identification

### Model Building

Machine learning models are built to:

- Predict future outcomes
- Classify data points
- Identify clusters
- Recommend actions
