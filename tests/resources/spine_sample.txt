This is a sample text file for testing the BookSpine project.

The BookSpine project is a comprehensive tool for calculating book spine dimensions and extracting keywords from book content. It provides both spine calculation functionality and keyword theme extraction capabilities.

Key features include:
- PDF page count extraction
- Spine width calculation based on paper type and binding
- Keyword extraction using KeyBERT
- Support for multiple file formats (PDF, Markdown, Text)
- Header weighting for improved keyword relevance
- Multi-word phrase prioritization

The project uses modern Python technologies including:
- PyPDF for PDF processing
- KeyBERT for keyword extraction
- Sentence transformers for semantic understanding
- NLTK for text preprocessing

This text file serves as a test resource for validating text processing capabilities across different file formats and content types.
